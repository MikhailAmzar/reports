# My reports repository
This repository contain various write-ups, playbooks and documentations of my learning journey for things like security tools/software, lab documentations, and just cybersecurity resources in general that I find interesting.

### Notice as of 9/6/2024
I might change the folder structures in the future to make it more organized and easy to look through.

## Navigation
1. The *cheat-sheets* folder should contain some cheatsheets for some of the stuff that I learnt previously.

2. The main directory should be where I keep all my reports for now. In the future I'll probably divide in into proper folders for *documentations*, *tutorials*, *resources*.

## Backlogs
- Add links to repos of other cybersec resources and roadmaps.
- Develop a portfolio page to share blogs and other writings (maybe).
